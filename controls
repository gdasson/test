Here‚Äôs how you can clearly justify choosing OPA Gatekeeper over Sysdig Admission Controller and Kubernetes VAP (Validating Admission Policy) for your specific PII/EBS-protection use case ‚Äî in a way that resonates with both security and platform engineering audiences.

‚∏ª

üéØ Context

You need fine-grained, auditable, and exception-aware admission control policies that:
	‚Ä¢	Enforce rules across custom CRDs (PVCs, Pods, ConfluentRoleBindings, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Reference external context (labels, namespaces, users, images, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Support per-policy exceptions and business waivers
	‚Ä¢	Are GitOps-driven and cluster-agnostic across many environments

‚∏ª

‚öñÔ∏è Why Sysdig Admission Controller and VAP don‚Äôt fully fit

Capability	K8s VAP (ValidatingAdmissionPolicy)	Sysdig Admission Controller	OPA Gatekeeper
Object lookup / cross-resource logic	‚ùå No external lookups allowed; can‚Äôt inspect related Pods or PVCs	‚ö†Ô∏è Limited to Sysdig‚Äôs internal metadata; no arbitrary K8s API queries	‚úÖ Full Rego engine with live Kubernetes ‚Äúinventory‚Äù cache; can check any object
Subresource support (exec, attach)	‚ùå Very limited; no access to target object fields	‚ö†Ô∏è Basic coverage only for runtime hooks	‚úÖ Can inspect the target Pod via lookup; supports exec/attach deny logic
Support for CustomResources (CRDs)	‚ö†Ô∏è Works only if CEL schema matches; no dynamic CRDs	‚ö†Ô∏è Not extensible to custom APIs	‚úÖ Native ‚Äî works for any CRD, e.g., Kafka, ConfluentRoleBinding, PVC, etc.
Policy exceptions / waivers	‚ùå None built-in; must hard-code	‚ö†Ô∏è Proprietary UI exceptions, not GitOps-friendly	‚úÖ CRD-based exception model via ConstraintTemplates; supports expiry, ID, owner
GitOps alignment	‚ö†Ô∏è Policy lives in cluster spec; poor version control	‚ö†Ô∏è Centralized SaaS-managed rules; not Git-driven	‚úÖ Fully declarative CRDs in Git; cluster reconciles via Flux/Fleet
Multi-cluster portability	‚ö†Ô∏è Feature gates differ per version	‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Sysdig backend connectivity	‚úÖ Runs anywhere; same Rego + constraints across RKE2, EKS, AKS
Auditing & dry-run mode	‚ö†Ô∏è Minimal	‚ö†Ô∏è Sysdig UI only	‚úÖ enforcementAction: dryrun for non-blocking audits
Open-source / vendor lock-in	‚úÖ Native but limited	‚ùå Proprietary to Sysdig	‚úÖ CNCF project, open ecosystem, widely audited
Community policy libraries	‚ö†Ô∏è Few examples	‚ùå None open	‚úÖ 1000+ reusable Rego policies (CIS, NIST, PodSecurity, etc.)

üß† Technical Rationale

1Ô∏è‚É£  Need for Cross-Object Awareness

You‚Äôre enforcing PVC exclusivity, exec-deny on protected Pods, and policy-driven exceptions.
‚û° Gatekeeper can look up the target Pod, PVC, Namespace, ServiceAccount, etc. in its cached inventory.
Neither VAP nor Sysdig can perform such lookups ‚Äî VAP‚Äôs CEL engine can‚Äôt reach other objects, and Sysdig‚Äôs controller isn‚Äôt designed for inter-object logic.

‚∏ª

2Ô∏è‚É£  Custom Resource Enforcement

Your platform uses CRDs like ConfluentRoleBinding, KafkaTopic, etc.
‚û° Gatekeeper works with any resource ‚Äî you just match apiGroups: ["*"].
VAP supports only built-in kinds defined in the cluster schema; Sysdig‚Äôs policies target standard Kubernetes objects only.

‚∏ª

3Ô∏è‚É£  Exception & Waiver Framework

You require an Archer-ID‚Äìbased exception process (per-policy, time-bounded).
‚û° Only Gatekeeper natively supports custom parameter CRDs (ConstraintTemplates) that reference an external registry (gatekeeper-exceptions repo).
VAP and Sysdig can‚Äôt manage exception lifecycles declaratively ‚Äî they‚Äôd require manual allow-listing or UI overrides.

‚∏ª

4Ô∏è‚É£  GitOps & Multi-Cluster Alignment

You operate dozens of clusters (RKE2, EKS).
‚û° Gatekeeper policies are YAML CRDs that sync seamlessly through Flux/Fleet ‚Äî same code, same enforcement everywhere.
Sysdig requires an external control plane and internet connectivity; VAP is version-gated to newer Kubernetes builds and can‚Äôt be uniformly managed across versions.

‚∏ª

5Ô∏è‚É£  Auditability & Dry-Run Testing

For enterprise adoption, you need a safe rollout path.
‚û° Gatekeeper provides enforcementAction: dryrun and detailed violation CRs.
VAP has no equivalent dry-run visibility; Sysdig exposes violations only via its SaaS dashboard.

‚∏ª

6Ô∏è‚É£  Proven Governance Ecosystem
	‚Ä¢	Gatekeeper integrates with OPA, Kyverno, and policy-reporter frameworks.
	‚Ä¢	You can reuse existing CIS and PodSecurity controls from open libraries.
	‚Ä¢	It‚Äôs vendor-neutral and supported by large open-source communities (Google, Microsoft, Red Hat, etc.).
Sysdig and VAP are either proprietary or cluster-version-bound, limiting extensibility.

‚∏ª

üß© Summary Justification

Gatekeeper is chosen because it is the only option that provides:
	‚Ä¢	Full cross-object validation (Pod ‚Üî PVC ‚Üî Namespace context)
	‚Ä¢	Support for CRDs and subresources
	‚Ä¢	Declarative exception and waiver process
	‚Ä¢	GitOps-friendly and multi-cluster portability
	‚Ä¢	Open-source, auditable, and vendor-neutral design

Whereas:
	‚Ä¢	VAP is lightweight but lacks object lookup, CRD support, and exception handling.
	‚Ä¢	Sysdig Admission Controller is closed-source, centralized, and primarily designed for runtime compliance visibility ‚Äî not declarative enforcement or GitOps workflows.
